# Applying Filters To SQL Queries

For this assignment, I am a security professional at a large organization. Part of my job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. I recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.


My task is to examine the organizationâ€™s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. I will need to use SQL filters in the MariaDB shell to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.
